## Environment Setup

### Recommanded Environment
we recommend using Docker for better experience

1. pull the image

```bash
docker pull edp-image-registry-cn-beijing.cr.volces.com/infer-public/galaxea_infer
```

2. start a container
```bash
docker run -itd \
  --name galaxea \
  --network host \
  --gpus all \
  -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
  -v /tmp/.X11-unix/X1:/tmp/.X11-unix/X11 \
  edp-image-registry-cn-beijing.cr.volces.com/infer-public/galaxea_infer:latest

```

3. execution with glx cli
```bash
docker exec -it galaxea bash

glx discovery 10.42.0.<ROBOT_PORT>
glx run <MODEL_DIR_NAME> # MODEL_DIR_NAME is the model directory under ~/.galaxea/models
```

4. Usage
for more usage, can try
```bash
glx help
```

### Prerequisites
- CUDA-capable GPU (RTX 4090 with CUDA driver over 12.8 is recommended for TensorRT)
- ROS2 Humble
- Python 3.10

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the EFMNode repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenGalaxea/EFMNode.git
cd EFMNode
```

2. **Clone and install the GalaxeaFM repository** (if not already done):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenGalaxea/GalaxeaVLA.git
cd GalaxeaFM
uv sync --index-strategy unsafe-best-match
uv pip install -e .
source .venv/bin/activate
cd ..
```

## Model Weights and Configuration

### Download Model Weights

1. Download the model checkpoint directory from the provided source
2. Extract it to your desired location (e.g., `/path/to/model/checkpoint/`)

The checkpoint directory should contain:
- `config.yaml` - Model configuration file
- `dataset_stats.json` - Dataset statistics for preprocessing
- Model weight files (`.pth`, `.pt`, or TensorRT engine files)

**Note for TensorRT users**: When using TensorRT (`use_trt = true`), the TensorRT plugin `gemma_rmsnorm.so` should be placed in `plugins/lib/` directory. The plugin path is automatically resolved relative to the project root.

### Configure `config.toml`

Edit `config.toml` in the project root to match your setup:

```toml
[robot]
hardware = "R1_LITE"  # or "R1_PRO"

[basic]
control_frequency = 15.0  # Control frequency in Hz
step_mode = "sync"        # "sync" or "async"
action_steps = 32         # Number of action steps per inference

[model]
ckpt_dir = "/path/to/ckpt/dir"  # Path to model checkpoint directory
use_trt = false                 # Set to true to use TensorRT acceleration
processor = "default"           # Processor type

[instruction]
use_vlm = true                      # Enable VLM-based instructions
bbox_as_instruction = false         # Use bounding boxes as instructions
image_condition_lang_prefix = true  # Use image condition with language prefix
pp_lower_half = false               # Post-process lower half
image_as_condition = true           # Use image as condition

[visualization]
enabled = true
output_dir = ""                     # Empty means: <ckpt_dir>/efmnode_action_viz
render_every_n_publishes = 5        # Refresh dashboard every N publish ticks
keep_chunks = 12
keep_publish_events = 400
```

**Important Configuration Notes:**
- Set `ckpt_dir` to the absolute path of your model checkpoint directory
- Set `use_trt = true` if you have TensorRT engines available
- Adjust `control_frequency` based on your hardware capabilities
- Modify `hardware` to match your robot model

## Running and Data Recording

### Running the Node

1. **Ensure ROS2 is sourced**:
```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash  # Adjust path for your ROS2 installation
```

2. **Run the node**:
```bash
./scripts/run.sh
```

The script `run.sh` automatically:
- Sets up environment variables (HF_ENDPOINT, PYTHONPATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
- Configures logging
- Runs the main script

### Data Recording

To record ROS2 topics for later analysis or replay:

```bash
./scripts/record.sh <output_bag_directory>
```

Example:
```bash
./scripts/record.sh /path/to/recordings/my_recording
```

The recording script captures:
- Camera topics (head depth, left/right wrist cameras)
- Feedback topics (grippers, arms, torso, chassis)
- Control topics (arm, gripper, chassis, torso control)
- Motion target topics
- TF transforms
- Progress indicators

**Note:** If the output directory already exists, it will be deleted before recording starts.

### Running with Custom Configuration

You can modify `config.toml` and restart the node to apply changes. The node will:
1. Load the configuration from `config.toml`
2. Load model configuration from `{ckpt_dir}/config.yaml`
3. Initialize the inference engine and processor
4. Connect to ROS2 topics
5. Start the control loop

### Action Chunk Visualization

When `[visualization].enabled = true`, EFMNode writes live debugging artifacts to:

```bash
<ckpt_dir>/efmnode_action_viz/
```

The most useful files are:

- `latest_dashboard.html` - interactive dashboard for the latest chunk, publish timing, inference-vs-horizon history, and a 3D EE path when EE actions are available
- `latest_summary.json` - compact snapshot of the latest chunk and recent publish events
- `trace.jsonl` - append-only event log of chunk predictions, publish ticks, and no-action ticks

This is useful when the robot looks stop-and-go, because the dashboard makes it easy to see whether inference is slower than the action horizon, whether the scheduler is missing publish ticks, and what command values the robot is actually receiving over time.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. **"No observation" messages**
- **Cause**: ROS2 topics are not publishing or not connected
- **Solution**: 
  - Verify ROS2 is running: `ros2 topic list`
  - Check if required topics are available
  - Ensure the robot hardware is connected and publishing

#### 2. **Model loading errors**
- **Cause**: Incorrect checkpoint path or missing files
- **Solution**:
  - Verify `ckpt_dir` in `config.toml` is correct
  - Ensure `config.yaml` and `dataset_stats.json` exist in the checkpoint directory
  - Check file permissions
